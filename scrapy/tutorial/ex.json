Why did the lion get lost in the jungle? Because the jungle massive! Brutal-ass jungle from our Splitter friend. More drugs than the Bayer opium field extracting the vibes and sweet resin. Has total groove this album, easy on the percussion, not too fast and quite relaxed but hardcore and fat like yo mumma. It is also featuring Madonna and Busta Rymes, or whatever is left of them after being put in the food processes. It is also well mastered this album. Not too loud. Track 5 is twisted to the maximum makes me nod my head like an American in a car with super suspension. Album is more experiemental and strange than you first think because it also unsweaty, and glides along seemlessly.

He comes from the Karkonosze Mountains between Poland and Czech Republic. In Poland they call him \"Liczyrzepa\" and in Czech his name \"Krakono\u0161\". <br>\n<br>\nHe is popular for his capricious behavior. In one second he can be your best friend, help you on your way through the woods and guide you, in the next second he can be cold and dark. He is equipped with strong powers. He can change his shape and even control the weather. <br>\n<br>\nHowever, what nobody knows: After centuries living in the mountains he felt the urge to move to the city. So now he is living in Berlin. But he still needs to\u00a0 make use of his incredible powers once in a while. So he chose to canalize those energy in music. Annoying Beatz Crew is proud to present the first manifestation of his forces. He spent\u00a0 nearly 20 years working on that EP, because he got distracted by the temptations, a city like Berlin has to offer, but it was worth the waiting. <br>\n<br>\nLinkz: <br>\nhttps://soundcloud.com/ruebezahl <br>\nannnoying.pl <br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<div class=\"clear-left\"></div>\n</div>"], "name": ["[ABC023] R\u00c3\u00bcbezahl - Trommelsalat - flac"]},
